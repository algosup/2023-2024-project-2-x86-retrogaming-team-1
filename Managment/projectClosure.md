# Closure Meeting Report

## Agenda

### 1. **Optimizing Group Meeting Frequency:**

- **Identified Challenge:** Insufficient pre-project group meetings resulted in the frequent absence of reassigned tasks when a group member was unable to complete their assignment.
- **Illustrative Example:** Despite some absence from our team members, we failed to redistribute tasks effectively, overlooking the prioritization of critical elements, such as addressing music concerns before collision issues.
- **Discussion:** Assess the impact of insufficient pre-project meetings on task allocation and project progress.
- **Action Plan:** Establish guidelines for the frequency of group meetings to ensure comprehensive project planning and task allocation.

### 2. **Enhancing Communication in Document Creation:**

- **Identified Issue:** Lack of communication in the creation of project documents.
- **Illustrative Example:** The inclusion of teleporters in the Functional documentation, unbeknownst to the development team, highlighted a communication breakdown.
- **Discussion:** Explore ways to improve communication channels for document creation and distribution.
- **Action Steps:** Implement strategies to enhance communication during document creation, ensuring clarity and completeness.

### 3. **Promoting Code Clarity and Comments:**

- **Identified Strength:** Clear and well-commented code observed during the project.
- **Discussion:** Acknowledge the positive aspects of code clarity and discuss methods to maintain this standard throughout future projects.
- **Action Items:** Encourage and reinforce the importance of clear and commented code as a best practice.

### 4. **Sustaining a Low Rate of Redundant Errors:**

- **Identified Strength:** Relatively no occurrence of redundant errors for a first-time project.
- **Discussion:** Discuss factors contributing to the successful reduction of redundant errors and identify areas for continuous improvement.
- **Action Items:** Document and share best practices that contributed to error reduction for future reference and improvement.

### 5. **Refining Task Prioritization:**

- **Identified Issue:** Inadequate prioritization of tasks, such as prioritizing sound over collision issues.
- **Illustrative Example:** Due to a lack of knowledge in Assembly coding, our team made the lives system instead of moving forces on the ghosts' AI, resulting in a critical oversight.
- **Discussion:** Analyze the impact of task prioritization on project outcomes and propose strategies for better prioritization.
- **Action Items:** Develop guidelines for effective task prioritization, emphasizing critical elements for project success.
