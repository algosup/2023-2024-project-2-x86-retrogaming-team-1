## Project Overview

This project is our version of the video game "Pac-Man" for the x86 architecture.
Our client is our school, ALGOSUP, a programming school in Vierzon, and our contact point is the school's CEO, Mr. Franck Jeannin.

## Project Scope

This project should be done in 7 weeks, from the 6th of November to the 22nd of December 2023.
By using the DOSBox emulator, the project should be done in Assembly language, using a 16-bit x86 architecture.

Pac-Man is still under copyright, but for our project, only educational and not commercial, we are allowed to use :

- The original sprites
- The original sounds
