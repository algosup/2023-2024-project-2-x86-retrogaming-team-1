## I. Overview

#### 1. The Project

![ALGOSUP logo's](img/logoALGOSUP.png)

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com)[^1] is an IT school located in Vierzon and the CEO of it is Mr Franck JEANNIN, with Natacha BOEZ and Eric LARCHEV√äQUE as co-founders.

The goal of this project is to recreate a Pac-Man game[^2] with some twists while keeping the style of the original game, we will obviously have to get a working game before adding any changes. In order to get a better immersion, we will be using an emulator[^3] from 90's computer to run, display and play the game.

#### 2. The current state of Retrogaming

##### A. Yesterday

Pac-Man is a game released during 1980, that was an immediate success. It is in the Top 5 of the best games from the 80's.
The game created by T≈çru Iwatani[^4] was imagined for women because at this time, main players were men. For that, he implemented a game without stereotypes and with basic and neutral colors. There are also 4 ghosts including one feminal, smarter than the 3 others.

##### B. Today

It is still one of the most famous games in the world. Everyone knows the little yellow diagram and the colors of the four ghosts.
Today, we have many new games (last one is Pac-Man World Re-Pac released the 08/26/2022), a little animated serie composed of 44 episodes, and lots of by-products.

##### C. Tomorrow

Pac-Man is the most bought game on the Atari 2600[^5], 9th on the Game Boy Advanced[^6], 3rd on mobile and is the best arcade selling. There is also Ms. Pac-Man which is the 5th most-selling arcade game.
Many new games keep getting released with tons of by-products, so Pac-Man will continue to exist for several decades.

## II. Goals and constraints

**Goals :**

- Recreate a Pac-Man game from 90's computer
- Improve the original game

**Constraints :**

- Programming language : Assembly[^7]
- Emulator : DOSBox[^8]
- 16-bit processor
- Respect the Pac-Man style

## III. Personas and scenario

#### 1. Herv√©

Herv√© has been Jacobi's communication director for 10 years. He is a vigorous 52 year old man. He divorced his wife 3 years ago with whom he had two children, Jessica and Nathan.

He leaves Salbris, his home, and arrives at Jacobi for 7:15 am. He turns on the two screens in the locker room and in the cafeteria. Then he goes on his computer, on the administrator account of the website, then he chooses the "Create" option and he sets each element of the scene (number of parts, widgets, text, image...) with the news of the day that his boss requested him to share with all the employees of the company the previous day. Once the settings are done, he saves the scene and shares it on both screens simultaneously.
Saving this scene will allow him to load it later if he wants to use it again or modify it.
At 7:30 A.M., when all the employees arrive at the plant, they can see the news directly when they prepare themselves in the locker room or when they have their coffee.

Pac-Man is a little circular diagram who navigate in the maze to eat all small points, but four ghosts navigate randomly in the maze and Pac-Man doesn't touch one of it. So, we have some bonus like big points, you can eat ghosts, or cherries to earn more points.
