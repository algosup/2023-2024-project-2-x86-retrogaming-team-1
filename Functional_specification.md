### II. Overview

#### 1. The Project

![ALGOSUP logo's](img/logoALGOSUP.png)

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com)[^1] is a Vierzon school's and the CEO of it is Mr Franck JEANNIN, with Natacha BOEZ and Eric LARCHEV√äQUE as co-founders.

He ask us to recreate a Pac-Man game[^2] with some update if possible but to respect the style of the original game. for the most immersive conditions, we use an emulator[^3] from 90's computer to run, display and play the game.

#### 2. What will happen for the retrogaming

##### A. Yesterday



##### B. Today

When the administrator, logs in with his account, He has the possibility, thanks to the "scene" tab in the navigation bar, to see the scenes that are shared on the screens, manage the scenes saved on the site for reuse or even modify them. But it can also create scenes in which it can integrate basic widgets like text or images, but also optional widgets like date, time, weather or news.
Thanks to the second tab "my account" the administrator can manage the various options of his account such as his password or his email address, but he can also have access to the site setting.
The "home" tab presents the company, its history and these values. You can access the company‚Äôs main site and have the site administrators email address so that employees can contact them if a problem is observed when sharing scenes on the screens.
Of course, employees will have limited access to the site. On their phone they will only be able to access the home page and the shared scene on the screen they decide to view.

##### C. Tomorrow

### IV. Personas and scenario

#### 1. Herv√©

Herv√© has been Jacobi's communications director for 10 years. He is a vigorous 52 year old man. He divorced his wife 3 years ago with whom he had two children, Jessica and Nathan.

He leaves Salbris, his home, and arrives at Jacobi for 7:15 am. He turns on the two screens in the locker room and in the cafeteria. Then he goes on his computer, on the administrator account of the site, then he chooses the "Create" option and he sets each element of the scene (number of parts, widgets, text, image...) with the news of the day that his boss asked him to share with all the employees of the company the day before. Once the settings are complete, he saves the scene and shares it on both screens simultaneously.
Saving his scene will allow him to load it later if he wants to use it again and to modify it.
At 7:30 a.m., When all employees arrive at the plant, they can see the news directly when they prepare in the locker room or when they have their coffee.

It's a game created by T≈çru Iwatani and edited by Namco in 1980 with the first arcade game and designed for women. Today, we have 32 game in arcade, flipper and console.
Pac-Man is a little circular diagram who navigate in the maze to eat all small points, but four ghosts navigate randomly in the maze and Pac-Man doesn't touch one of it. So, we have some bonus like big points, you can eat ghosts, or cherries to earn more points.
