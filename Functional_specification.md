## I. Overview

### 1. Project scope

![ALGOSUP logo's](img/logoALGOSUP.png)

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com)[^1] give the project to recreate a Pac-Man game[^2] with some twists while keeping the style of the original game, we will obviously have to get a working game before adding any changes. In order to get a better immersion, we will be using an emulator[^3] from 90's computer to run, display and play the game.

### 3. The current state of Pac-Man

(explain PAC-MAN game)

#### A. Yesterday

Pac-Man is a game released during 1980, that was an immediate success. It is in the Top 5 of the best games from the 80's.
The game created by T≈çru Iwatani[^4] was imagined for women because at this time, main players were men. For that, he implemented a game without stereotypes and with basic and neutral colors. There are also 4 ghosts including one feminal, smarter than the 3 others.

#### B. Today

It is still one of the most famous games in the world. Everyone knows the little yellow diagram and the colors of the four ghosts.
Today, we have many new games (last one is Pac-Man World Re-Pac released the 08/26/2022), a little animated serie composed of 44 episodes, and lots of by-products.

#### C. Tomorrow

Pac-Man is the most bought game on the Atari 2600[^5], 9th on the Game Boy Advanced[^6], 3rd on mobile and is the best arcade selling. There is also Ms. Pac-Man which is the 5th most-selling arcade game.
Many new games keep getting released with tons of by-products, so Pac-Man will continue to exist for several decades.

## V. Personas and scenario

> **Target audience**

Pac-Man is a world-wide known game and built its place in the heart of a lot of players. Our product is therefore intended to men and women, young and old people, new player and nostalgic player. Pac-Man is a PEGI 3[^9] game and an Everyone ESRB[^10].

### 1. Herv√©

Herv√© is a nostalgic player who knows Pac-Man since its release. He is a 52 year old man. He divorced his wife 3 years ago with whom he had two children, Jessica and Nathan who are 12 and 21 years old. He lives in a little house with a garden in Nan√ßay with Jessica. Nathan live in UK for his studies. He has all nostalgic game like the Game Boy, Atari 7800[^11] or the Apple Pippin[^12]. He works in a little restaurant as a chef.

Jessica showed him a new version of Pac-Man on her computer with new features and he wanted to try to play this game to get a flashback of the good old times he had playing it. He installs the game on his computer and launches the game.
He is on the home page of the game with play, exit and setting buttons. He clicks directly on play button and the maze is display with the Inky, Pinky and Clyde ghosts in their house in the middle of the maze, Blinky outside the door house in the top of the house, Pac-Man in the middle of the seventh line on the bottom of the maze and all points on all paths. There is one big point on each end of the the same line of the Pac-Man and of the line three on the top.
Nothing move but the music start and when he clicks on the right arrow, the Pac-Man start to move on the right. He eats his first points with the sound and earn 50 on the score. After, he goes up with the up arrow, right and down. Herv√© eats a big point and the score increase of two hundred.
He continues to browse the maze but Pinky eat it one time and he loss one life. During 3 minutes, Herv√© try to eat all points on the maze but he loss all his lifes. The Game over screen appears on the display for 5 seconds and then returns to the home page. He wants to retry, but he has to go to work. Click on the exit button and the game closes.
He'll take his revenge in the evening.

### 2. Jessica

Jessica is the Herv√©'s daughter, 12 years old and she lives with her father. She has a brother, Nathan, 21 years old but he lives in UK for his studies.Her father gave her a passion for retrogames, and for the past two years she has been discovering new versions of arcade games on her computer.

Today, while browsing a site where all the games can be found, she discovered Pac-Man and decided to install it.
It arrives on the home page with the play, exit and setting buttons. She doesn't know the game, so she clicks on setting and finds the commands she needs to play the game. It can also switch music and sounds on and off. Once she's made her few adjustments, she clicks on the back button to return to the home page.
She clicks on play and moves Pac-Man to the left using the left arrow. Jessica doesn't like playing with music and sounds, so she turned everything off. All she sees are people passing over the dots to make them disappear and increase her score.
She gets caught by the ghosts, who cause her to lose lives, but after several trial rounds, she discovers a new bonus, a cherry. Thanks to this bonus, she has the power to eat ghosts for 10 seconds. She finally finishes the game and the Win page is displayed for 5 seconds with her score, then she returns to the home page.
She then decides to go and see her father to show him the game she's just discovered and loves.

### 3. Vanessa

Vanessa is

Today, Vanessa wants to rediscover an old game on her computer and found our game. The goal is always the same : eat every dots as fast as possible without getting eaten by the ghosts.

## VI. Solution Overview

<!-- TODO -->

## VII. Risk Mitigation

**Some risks that could lead to the failure of the project :**

- Too ambitious : improving the game to a point where we forget its roots, but also creating unnecessary features. Which could basically lead us to an unfinished game.
- Too simple : sticking to the original game without trying to improve it.
- Copyright[^11] regulations : make features that are not in compliance with the copyright law.

**Yet those risks can be avoided by :**

- Make sure that we are keeping the core gameplay from the original game, not focusing too much on the features in order to provide a complete and working game.
- Brainstorming and discussing about the features we want to add the game, that could improve the player's game experience.
- Regarding the copyright law, as we are working on an educational project, there won't be any problem. We won't sell our game nor get any profit from it.

## VIII. Security

> **Copyright**

The game is under copyright protection and we need to respect some rules in compliance to the law :

- The author enjoys a perpetual, inalienable and imprescriptible right to respect for his name, his status and his work (Article L121-1)
- Must in no way interfere with the normal exploitation of the work, nor cause unjustified prejudice to the legitimate interests of the author (Article L122-5)
- The author may not prohibit the reproduction of excerpts of works for the exclusive purpose of illustration in the context of education and vocational training (Article L122-5 12¬∞)
- Right to reproduce the game for non-profit purposes (Article L122-5-1)

> **Data saving**

There are three different archives depending on the type of data :

- Active database archiving where data that are no longer useful to the enterprise (for example, data on job seekers to which they have not followed up) are deleted once the reason for the study has been completed (after a maximum of two years).
- Intermediate archiving where data are saved even after the purpose of data collection has been achieved as they are still of interest to the enterprise. The duration is set by the person responsible and must be relevant to its usefulness.
- Final archiving where data that remains of great interest in the future without an end date are saved, after an upstream check.

> **Age**

The age to play at certain game is regulated by the PEGI limitation in Europeen Union or the ESRB in USA.
Criterias are the violence, drugs, sex or money game.

## X. Evaluation criteria

We will consider this project a success if we have a working game coontaining the original game and some new features. Every knowledge acquired during the project will be a bonus, adding to the global success rating of the project.
