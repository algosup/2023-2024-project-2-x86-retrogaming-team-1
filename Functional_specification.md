## I. Overview

#### 1. The Project

![ALGOSUP logo's](img/logoALGOSUP.png)

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com)[^1] is a Vierzon school's and the CEO of it is Mr Franck JEANNIN, with Natacha BOEZ and Eric LARCHEV√äQUE as co-founders.

He ask us to recreate a Pac-Man game[^2] with some update if possible but to respect the style of the original game. for the most immersive conditions, we use an emulator[^3] from 90's computer to run, display and play the game.

#### 2. What will happen for the retrogaming

##### A. Yesterday

Pac-Man it's a game out in 1980 and it was a immediate success. It is in the Top 5 of best games of 80's.
The game created by T≈çru Iwatani[^4] is imagined for women because at this time, main player are men. For that, he implement a game without stereotypes and with basic and neutral colors. There is also four ghosts including one feminal which is more intelligent than three others.

##### B. Today

It's again one of the best-known game in the world. Everyone know the little yellow diagram and the colors of his four ghosts.
Today, we have many new games (last one is Pac-Man World Re-Pac out the 08/26/2022), a little animation serie with 44 episodes and lots of by-products.

##### C. Tomorrow

Pac-Man is the first game purchased on the Atari 2600[^5], ninth on the Game Boy Advanced[^6], third on phone and it's the best arcade selling. There is also Ms. Pac-Man which is the fifth arcade game most selling.
Many new games out again with many by-products, so Pac-Man continue will continue to exist for several decades.

## II. Goals and constraints

**Goals :**

- recreate a Pac-Man game from 90's computer
- improve the original game

**Constraints :**

- programming language : Assembly[^7]
- emulator : DOSBox[^8]
- 16 bit processor
- respect the Pac-Man style

## III. Personas and scenario

#### 1. Herv√©

Herv√© has been Jacobi's communications director for 10 years. He is a vigorous 52 year old man. He divorced his wife 3 years ago with whom he had two children, Jessica and Nathan.

He leaves Salbris, his home, and arrives at Jacobi for 7:15 am. He turns on the two screens in the locker room and in the cafeteria. Then he goes on his computer, on the administrator account of the site, then he chooses the "Create" option and he sets each element of the scene (number of parts, widgets, text, image...) with the news of the day that his boss asked him to share with all the employees of the company the day before. Once the settings are complete, he saves the scene and shares it on both screens simultaneously.
Saving his scene will allow him to load it later if he wants to use it again and to modify it.
At 7:30 a.m., When all employees arrive at the plant, they can see the news directly when they prepare in the locker room or when they have their coffee.
