## I. Overview

#### 1. Project scope

![ALGOSUP logo's](img/logoALGOSUP.png)

[ALGOSUP](https://algosup.com)[^1] give the project to recreate a Pac-Man game[^2] with some twists while keeping the style of the original game, we will obviously have to get a working game before adding any changes. In order to get a better immersion, we will be using an emulator[^3] from 90's computer to run, display and play the game.

#### 3. The current state of Pac-Man

(explain PAC-MAN game)

##### A. Yesterday

Pac-Man is a game released during 1980, that was an immediate success. It is in the Top 5 of the best games from the 80's.
The game created by T≈çru Iwatani[^4] was imagined for women because at this time, main players were men. For that, he implemented a game without stereotypes and with basic and neutral colors. There are also 4 ghosts including one feminal, smarter than the 3 others.

##### B. Today

It is still one of the most famous games in the world. Everyone knows the little yellow diagram and the colors of the four ghosts.
Today, we have many new games (last one is Pac-Man World Re-Pac released the 08/26/2022), a little animated serie composed of 44 episodes, and lots of by-products.

##### C. Tomorrow

Pac-Man is the most bought game on the Atari 2600[^5], 9th on the Game Boy Advanced[^6], 3rd on mobile and is the best arcade selling. There is also Ms. Pac-Man which is the 5th most-selling arcade game.
Many new games keep getting released with tons of by-products, so Pac-Man will continue to exist for several decades.

## V. Use case

![use case](img/)

## VI. Risks and Assumptions

The project has some risks :
- Too ambitious : want to improve too much the game and forgot the original game or create features unnecessary.

- Too simple : keep the original game without improvement and not enough features.
- Copyright[^11] regulations : made features which are not in compliance with the copyright law.

## VII. Security

**Copyright**

The game is under copyright protection and we need to respect some rules in compliance to the law :
- The author enjoys a perpetual, inalienable and imprescriptible right to respect for his name, his status and his work (Article L121-1)
- Must in no way interfere with the normal exploitation of the work, nor cause unjustified prejudice to the legitimate interests of the author (Article L122-5)
- The author may not prohibit the reproduction of excerpts of works for the exclusive purpose of illustration in the context of education and vocational training (Article L122-5 12¬∞)
- Right to reproduce the game for non-profit purposes (Article L122-5-1)

**Data saving**

There are three different archives depending on the type of data :
- Active database archiving where data that are no longer useful to the enterprise (for example, data on job seekers to which they have not followed up) are deleted once the reason for the study has been completed (after a maximum of two years).
- Intermediate archiving where data are saved even after the purpose of data collection has been achieved as they are still of interest to the enterprise. The duration is set by the person responsible and must be relevant to its usefulness.
- Final archiving where data that remains of great interest in the future without an end date are saved, after an upstream check.

**Age**

The age to play at certain game is regulated by the PEGI limitation in Europeen Union or the ESRB in USA.
Criterias are the violence, drugs, sex or money game.

## VIII. Cost



## IX. Solution Overview




## X. Evaluation criteria

We will consider this project a success if we have a working game coontaining the original game and some new features. Every knowledge acquired during the project will be a bonus, adding to the global success rating of the project.
