## Week 1

This week was the introduction to the project, recreate Pac-Man in x86 assembly. None of us knows assembly, that's why, for the first week, our Software Engineers Senior and Junior decided to learn the basics of assembly and to create a simple program in assembly, the "Hello World" program.

During this time, the other members were working on the functional specifications of the project and the project management.
