## Project Management

### GitHub Project

Because Trello is not adapted to GitHub's projects, we decided to use GitHub's projects because they are directly linked to the repository, allowing us to link our pull requests and issues to the tasks.

This GitHub Project is getting 3 different ways to be used:

- The Trello version, where you can find all the differents tasks placed depending of their completion level;
- The task list, that is just a list of all the project's related tasks done during the project's period (As an example, learning assembly was essential but not written inside, because it wasn't a required task);
- The Roadmap version, that is a Gantt chart that shows the project's progression. The only problem is that is not allowing us to link the tasks to create dependencies.

### Project Follow-up

Instead of a Gantt chart, we created a Project Follow-up on Google Sheets. Obviously, the result is not as good as a Gantt chart but it is still a good way to follow the project's progress.
