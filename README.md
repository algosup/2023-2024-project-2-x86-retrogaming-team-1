## How to play

### Requirements

To play the game, you will need to install [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1) and to download the .zip file of this GitHub Project and unzip it.

If you are on MacOS, you must ensure that Dosbox is installed in the Applications folder. While on Windows, you don't need to do anything, because the installer is automatically installing Dosbox in the Program Files folder.

### Launching the game

Then, depending on your operating system, you must follow the following instructions:

On MacOS:

Open the terminal and move to where your unzipped folder is located. Then, you must type the following command:

```bash
cd src
./build.bash
```

On Windows:

Open the file explorer and move to the folder where your unzipped folder is located. Then, you must go in the `src` folder and double click on the `build.cmd` file.

In both cases, the game will be compiled, open dosbox and launch the game automatically.

### Playing the game

Once the game is launched, you will be able to play it. To move PAC-MAN, you must use the arrow keys.

#### Warning

We implemented some sounds in the game, but sometimes, depending on the machine, the sound may be a bit aggressive for the ears. So, we recommend you to lower the volume of your computer before playing the game, especially if you are wearing headphones.
